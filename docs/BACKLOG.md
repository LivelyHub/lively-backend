# lively-backend — Build Backlog

> The backend half of Lively (Fastify + Neon Postgres). Derived from [CORE.md](../CORE.md) (schema + API contract, source of truth in this repo), [SPEC.md](../SPEC.md) (MVP scope), [PLAN.md](../PLAN.md) (schedule + cut-order). The mobile backlog lives in `lively-mobile/docs/BACKLOG.md`; the two share the CORE.md contract.

**Priorities:** **P0** demo spine · **P1** credible demo · **P2** polish. Cut-order (PLAN.md): titipan and missed-day alerts drop first, then B10 (performance report); the irreducible core is elder creation, conversation logging, and chair-test recording.

**How to use this file:** work stories in priority order, top to bottom. Tick each acceptance box **in the same PR that satisfies it** — this file is the shared, checkable record of progress. A story is done only when its boxes are ticked *and* its test steps (in [TESTING.md](TESTING.md)) pass. See [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for the working agreement.

## Epic B0 — Project scaffold `P0`

### B0.1 Fastify + TypeScript skeleton `P0`
- [x] `npm run dev` starts the server on `PORT` from `.env`
- [x] `GET /health` returns `200 {"status":"ok","db":"connected"|"down"}`
- [x] All errors return `{ "error": { "code": string, "message": string } }` — never a raw stack trace
- [x] Unknown routes return 404 in the same error shape
- [x] `.env.example` lists `DATABASE_URL`, `BOT_SERVICE_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`, `PORT` (already present — keep in sync)

**Test:** `curl /health` → 200; `curl /nope` → 404 with error shape; start without `DATABASE_URL` → clear startup error, not a crash loop. ✅ All verified.
**Depends on:** nothing.

### B0.2 Neon connectivity verified from venue `P0` 🔴
The #1 risk in SPEC §7. Do this before anything else on Day 1.
- [x] Connection to Neon succeeds (verified from dev machine; re-verify from actual venue Wi-Fi on Day 1 per the risk note)
- [x] Fallback rehearsed: local Postgres via Docker (`docker compose up db`), same migrations, connection swap is one env var (local port 5433, not 5432 — this machine already has a local Postgres 17 on 5432)
- [x] `docker-compose.yml` with a Postgres service committed

**Test:** `GET /health` shows `"db":"connected"` on venue network; kill Neon URL, point at local Docker, health goes green again. ✅ Verified against local Docker; venue-network retest still needed on Day 1.
**Depends on:** B0.1.

### B0.3 Migration tool decided + wired `P0`
Resolves the 🟡 in SPEC §5. **Decision: Drizzle ORM + drizzle-kit** — schema-as-code in TypeScript (`src/db/schema.ts`), `drizzle-kit generate` produces committed SQL migration files, `drizzle-kit migrate` applies them. Lighter than Prisma, keeps raw SQL visibility, and the generated query builder still gives route handlers type safety.
- [x] `npx drizzle-kit generate` creates SQL migrations from `src/db/schema.ts`; `npx drizzle-kit migrate` applies them
- [x] Migration files committed (`drizzle/0000_flashy_jubilee.sql`); `npx drizzle-kit migrate` verified against a fresh DB (local Docker Postgres, dropped schema and re-migrated from zero)

**Test:** drop the local DB, run migrations from zero, schema matches CORE.md §1. ✅ Verified via `docker compose` Postgres — schema matches, includes required indexes (B1.1).
**Depends on:** B0.2.

---

## Epic B1 — Schema & seed data `P0`

### B1.1 Full CORE.md schema `P0`
All 10 tables from CORE.md §1 (freeze after Day 1): `elders`, `family_members`, `companions`, `conversations`, `chair_test_results`, `exercise_logs`, `medications`, `medication_logs`, `alerts`, `titipan_messages`.
- [ ] Every table + column from CORE.md §1 exists, including enums/checks: `conversations.direction ∈ {in,out}`, `alerts.type ∈ {missed_days, pain_mention, dizziness_mention, medication_missed, no_response, emergency}`, `exercise_logs.method` and `medication_logs.method ∈ {reply, emoji, photo}`, `chair_test_results.source = 'chat'`
- [ ] Foreign keys: `elders.family_member_id → family_members`, `elders.companion_id → companions`, child tables → `elders`, `medication_logs.medication_id → medications`
- [ ] `elders.health_flags` and `medications.schedule_times` are array columns
- [ ] Indexes on hot reads: `conversations(elder_id, created_at)`, `alerts(elder_id, created_at)`, `medication_logs(medication_id, taken_at)`

**Test:** migration from zero passes; inserting an alert with a bogus type fails; TESTING.md schema checklist.
**Depends on:** B0.3.

### B1.2 Seed script — companions + demo elder `P0`
- [ ] `npm run seed` is idempotent (safe to re-run)
- [ ] Seeds both companions: `mbak_asih` ("Mbak Asih"), `mas_budi` ("Mas Budi")
- [ ] Seeds a demo family member (known email/password for demo login) + elder "Eyang Uti" (honorific "Eyang Uti", health flags `["knee_pain"]`)
- [ ] Chair-test history: ~4 results climbing 8 → 9 → 11 → 12 (the Progress chart's story arc)
- [ ] ~10 seeded conversation messages (mixed in/out) so Chat Monitor isn't empty
- [ ] A few exercise logs (streak of 3+) and one active medication ("Amlodipine", `["07:00"]`) with logs

**Test:** run seed twice → no duplicates; `GET /elders/:id/conversation` returns seeded messages; progress shows 8→12.
**Depends on:** B1.1.

---

## Epic B2 — Auth `P0`

### B2.1 Family register + login (JWT) `P0`
⚠️ **CORE.md gap** (see Amendments): CORE §2 says JWT is "issued by backend" but lists no auth endpoints. Adds `POST /auth/register`, `POST /auth/login`.
- [ ] `POST /auth/register` `{email, name, password}` → `family_members` row (argon2/bcrypt hash — needs `password_hash` column, see Amendments) → `{token, familyMember}`
- [ ] `POST /auth/login` `{email, password}` → `{token, familyMember}`; wrong password → 401
- [ ] JWT signed with `JWT_SECRET`, carries `family_member_id`, expiry ≥ 72h
- [ ] Duplicate email on register → 409 with error shape

**Test:** register → login → decoded token has the right id; wrong password 401; TESTING.md auth matrix.
**Depends on:** B1.1.

### B2.2 Auth middleware — JWT + bot key `P0`
- [ ] `requireFamily` preHandler: validates `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`, attaches `familyMemberId`; 401 on missing/invalid/expired
- [ ] `requireBot` preHandler: validates `X-Bot-Key` against `BOT_SERVICE_KEY` (constant-time compare); 401 on mismatch
- [ ] Route ownership: family routes only touch elders where `elder.family_member_id = familyMemberId`; cross-family → 404 (don't leak existence)
- [ ] Route→guard mapping matches CORE §2's Consumer column exactly

**Test:** full auth matrix in TESTING.md; family A requesting family B's elder → 404.
**Depends on:** B2.1.

---

## Epic B3 — Elder management `P0`

### B3.1 `POST /elders` — create `P0`
- [ ] Body `{name, honorific, phone_e164, companion_key, health_flags}`
- [ ] Validates: honorific non-empty (CORE §3), phone E.164, companion key ∈ {mbak_asih, mas_budi}, health flags known-list with free-text passthrough
- [ ] Creates row linked to the authenticated family member; 201 with the full elder
- [ ] Invalid companion / malformed phone → 400 with field-level detail

**Test:** happy path 201; each validation failure 400; readable via B3.3.
**Depends on:** B2.2.

### B3.2 `PATCH /elders/:id` — switch companion / honorific / pause `P0`
- [ ] Partial body `{companion_key?, honorific?, health_flags?, paused?}` (`paused` needs a column — see Amendments; CORE §2 lists "pause" as this endpoint's job)
- [ ] Only the owning family member can patch; others 404
- [ ] Companion switch takes effect on the next bot context read; no past-conversation migration
- [ ] Returns the updated elder

**Test:** patch each field; verify persistence; cross-family patch → 404.
**Depends on:** B3.1.

### B3.3 `GET /elders` + `GET /elders/:id` `P0`
⚠️ **CORE.md gap** (Amendments): mobile Home can't render without reading elders back.
- [ ] `GET /elders` → the family member's elders, each with companion joined + a status summary (last message at, open alert count)
- [ ] `GET /elders/:id` → single elder, 404 if not owned
- [ ] New account → `200 []`, not an error

**Test:** new account → `[]`; seeded account → Eyang Uti with companion; cross-family → 404.
**Depends on:** B3.1.

---

## Epic B4 — Conversation log `P0`

### B4.1 `POST /bot/inbound` — log elder message + return companion context `P0`
- [ ] Bot-key auth; body `{elder_phone_e164, body}` — backend resolves phone → elder
- [ ] Inserts `conversations` row `direction:'in'`
- [ ] Response carries the CompanionConfig contract (CORE §3): `{elder_id, companion:{key, honorific, healthFlags}, paused, recent_messages: last 10}`
- [ ] Unknown phone → 404
- [ ] Paused elder: message still logged, response `paused: true`

**Test:** post with seeded phone → row + context matches CORE §3; unknown phone 404.
**Depends on:** B2.2, B1.2.

### B4.2 `POST /bot/outbound` — log companion message `P0`
- [ ] Bot-key auth; body `{elder_id, body}` → `direction:'out'` row (CORE §4: logs after the fact, no timing enforcement)
- [ ] Supports 1–3 message splits: three rapid calls → three ordered rows (`created_at` monotonic)

**Test:** three rapid posts → three ordered rows; appears in B4.3.
**Depends on:** B4.1.

### B4.3 `GET /elders/:id/conversation` — Chat Monitor read `P0`
- [ ] Family JWT + ownership
- [ ] `?limit=30&before=<cursor>` — newest first, `before` pages older
- [ ] Response `{messages:[{id, direction, body, created_at}], next_cursor}`
- [ ] Empty conversation → `{messages:[], next_cursor:null}`
- [ ] `?after=<cursor>` returns only newer messages (poll-friendly)

**Test:** page with `before`; `after` returns only new rows after a bot inbound; empty for a fresh elder.
**Depends on:** B4.1, B4.2.

---

## Epic B5 — Assessments & exercise `P0`

### B5.1 `POST /assessments/chair-test` `P0`
- [ ] Bot-key auth; body `{elder_id, reps:int, recorded_at?}`; `source` fixed `'chat'`
- [ ] `reps` sanity-bounded 0–60; out of range → 400
- [ ] 201 with the row

**Test:** valid 201; `reps:200` → 400; shows in B5.3.
**Depends on:** B2.2.

### B5.2 `POST /exercise-logs` `P0`
- [ ] Bot-key auth; body `{elder_id, method, completed_at?}`
- [ ] One log per elder per day (idempotent); duplicate same-day → 200 existing row

**Test:** two posts same day → one row; different days → two.
**Depends on:** B2.2.

### B5.3 `GET /elders/:id/progress` — Progress aggregate `P0`
⚠️ **CORE.md gap** (Amendments): SPEC §3 promises "backend aggregates → mobile renders" but no read endpoint exists. One aggregate call = one mobile skeleton. Also the data source for the gamification screen (CORE.md §7): progress bar, streak, and graphs.
- [ ] Family JWT + ownership
- [ ] Response:
  ```json
  {
    "overall_progress_pct": 78,
    "engagement_streak_days": 5,
    "chair_tests": [{"reps": 8, "recorded_at": "..."}],
    "exercise": {"current_streak_days": 3, "this_week": ["2026-07-14"], "total": 12},
    "exercise_history": [{"date": "2026-07-14", "completed": true}],
    "medication_adherence": {"last7d_taken": 6, "last7d_scheduled": 7, "unconfirmed_today": ["Amlodipine 19:00"]},
    "medication_adherence_trend": [{"date": "2026-07-14", "taken": 1, "scheduled": 1}]
  }
  ```
- [ ] Chair tests oldest→newest (chart-ready), capped last 20
- [ ] `exercise_history` and `medication_adherence_trend`: last 30 days, oldest→newest (chart-ready)
- [ ] `overall_progress_pct` = average of `latest_reps/15*100`, `current_streak_days/7*100`, `last7d_taken/last7d_scheduled*100`, each capped at 100 (CORE.md §7 — tuning constants, keep in sync with mobile)
- [ ] `engagement_streak_days` = consecutive calendar days with ≥1 of {exercise_logs, medication_logs, chair_test_results} row (broader than `exercise.current_streak_days`)
- [ ] Zero-data elder → zeros/empty arrays, 200

**Test:** seeded shows 8→12 + streak + progress % computed correctly; fresh elder returns empty shapes and `overall_progress_pct: 0`.
**Depends on:** B5.1, B5.2 (adherence block lands with B6.2).

---

## Epic B6 — Medications `P1`

### B6.1 `POST /medications` + `PATCH /medications/:id` + `GET /elders/:id/medications` `P1`
⚠️ **CORE.md gap** (Amendments): SPEC §4 says "adds/**edits**"; mobile needs the list.
- [ ] `POST` (family JWT) `{elder_id, name, dosage, schedule_times:["07:00"], active?}` — times `HH:MM`, ≥1
- [ ] `PATCH /medications/:id` partial incl. `active:false` (soft-disable, never delete — logs reference it)
- [ ] `GET /elders/:id/medications` — active meds with today's per-slot status (`taken`/`unconfirmed`/`upcoming`)
- [ ] Ownership checks throughout

**Test:** create → list shows with slots; deactivate → drops from reminders, history stays; bad time 400.
**Depends on:** B3.3.

### B6.2 `POST /medication-logs` `P1`
- [ ] Bot-key auth; body `{medication_id, elder_id, method, taken_at?}`
- [ ] Validates medication belongs to elder; mismatch → 400
- [ ] Idempotent per medication + slot
- [ ] Feeds B6.1 status + B5.3 adherence

**Test:** log → list flips to `taken`; double-post → one row.
**Depends on:** B6.1.

### B6.3 Missed-dose detection → `medication_missed` alert `P1`
CORE §5: no confirmation within grace (default 2h) just shows unconfirmed; **2 consecutive misses** raise `medication_missed`. Counting misses across days is backend state so the bot stays stateless.
- [ ] A slot with no log 2h past its time counts as missed (lazily on read or a light interval job — document which)
- [ ] 2 consecutive missed slots → one `medication_missed` via the B7.1 path (fires once, not per-read)
- [ ] Grace window + consecutive threshold are per-elder-overridable constants (defaults 2h / 2)

**Test:** seed a past med with no logs across 2 slots → alert exists; 1 miss → none.
**Depends on:** B6.2, B7.1.

---

## Epic B7 — Alerts & escalation `P1`

### B7.1 `POST /alerts` — all six types `P1`
- [ ] Bot-key auth; body `{elder_id, type, payload}`; `type` ∈ the six enum values
- [ ] `payload` carries type context (e.g. `{quote:"lutut saya sakit sekali"}`) stored as JSON, echoed to mobile
- [ ] Fan-out: targets **every** family member linked to the elder — no hardcoded single recipient (CORE §6)
- [ ] Duplicate suppression: same elder + type within 30 min → 200 existing, no re-push

**Test:** each of 6 types inserts; bogus type 400; duplicate within window → single row.
**Depends on:** B2.2.

### B7.2 Push trigger (Expo) `P1`
SPEC §6 leaves *delivery* to mobile, but something must call Expo Push when an alert lands, and the backend is the only party that sees every alert at creation. **Decision: backend POSTs to `https://exp.host/--/api/v2/push/send` directly** using `family_members.push_token`; mobile's job (M8.1) is registering the token. Polling is the fallback if push flakes.
- [ ] On alert insert: for each linked family member with a `push_token`, POST type-tiered copy (UI-UX §5: `emergency` = urgent + max priority; `no_response` = soft nudge)
- [ ] Push failure never fails the alert insert (fire-and-forget, logged error)
- [ ] `PATCH /family-members/me` accepts `{push_token}` (⚠️ Amendment — mobile needs a write path)

**Test:** insert `emergency` with a real Expo token → notification on device; dead token → alert still 201.
**Depends on:** B7.1.

### B7.3 `GET /alerts` + `PATCH /alerts/:id/resolve` `P1`
⚠️ **CORE.md gap** (Amendments): schema has `resolved_at`; mobile must list + resolve.
- [ ] `GET /alerts?elder_id=&unresolved_only=true` (family JWT, ownership) — newest first, includes payload
- [ ] `PATCH /alerts/:id/resolve` sets `resolved_at`; already-resolved → 200 idempotent
- [ ] Manual-urgent (CORE §6): `PATCH /alerts/:id {type:'emergency'}` lets family escalate

**Test:** raise → unresolved list → resolve → drops from `unresolved_only`.
**Depends on:** B7.1.

---

## Epic B8 — Titipan (family relay) `P2`

### B8.1 `POST /elders/:id/titipan` `P2`
- [ ] Family JWT + ownership; body `{body}` (≤500 chars); inserts `delivered_at:null`
- [ ] 201 `{id, body, delivered_at:null}`

### B8.2 Bot delivery queue `P2`
⚠️ **CORE.md gap** (Amendments): the bot must fetch undelivered titipan and mark them sent.
- [ ] `GET /bot/titipan-queue?elder_id=` (bot key) → undelivered oldest-first
- [ ] `PATCH /bot/titipan/:id/delivered` sets `delivered_at`

**Test:** post → queue → mark delivered → gone from queue, `delivered_at` set.
**Depends on:** B8.1.

---

## Epic B9 — Demo hardening `P1`

### B9.1 Validation everywhere `P1`
- [ ] Every route body/params validated (zod or TypeBox); no unvalidated input reaches a query
- [ ] Validation errors → 400 `{error:{code:'VALIDATION', message, fields:{...}}}`

### B9.2 CORS + logging `P1`
- [ ] CORS open to Expo dev origins (`*` acceptable — SPEC §6 waives abuse protection)
- [ ] Request logging (pino) with route + status + latency

### B9.3 Deployed and reachable `P1`
- [ ] Deployed (Railway / Render / Fly) with env vars set
- [ ] `GET /health` green from a phone on cellular (the demo-day network escape hatch)
- [ ] `BACKEND_API_URL` shared with mobile + bot teams

**Test:** full TESTING.md smoke script against the deployed URL from a phone hotspot.
**Depends on:** everything P0.

---

## Epic B10 — Performance report `P1` 🟡 first-in-line to cut
Post-kickoff addition (mentor/judge feedback: gamification makes checking on Eyang feel like a shared win, not a compliance chore). The progress bar/streak/graphs in B5.3 already deliver most of that value cheaply — this epic is the one genuinely new endpoint, so it's the first thing to drop if Day 3 runs short (PLAN.md cut-order).

### B10.1 `GET /elders/:id/report?period=week|month` `P1`
- [ ] Family JWT + ownership; `period` defaults to `week`
- [ ] Response matches CORE.md §7 shape: `period`, `range`, `headline`, `consistency_pct`, `exercise`, `medication_adherence_pct`, `chair_test_trend`, `highlights[]`, `areas_needing_support[]`
- [ ] `consistency_pct` = % of days in range with ≥1 engagement row (same definition as B5.3's streak, windowed)
- [ ] `chair_test_trend` ∈ `improving`/`stable`/`declining`, comparing first vs. last chair-test result in range
- [ ] Copy tone: `headline` and `highlights` always lead positive; `areas_needing_support` is encouragement-framed, never guilt ("could use a nudge on evening doses", not "missed medication")
- [ ] Zero-data elder → `consistency_pct: 0`, empty arrays, still 200 with a gentle headline ("Eyang Uti is just getting started")

**Test:** seeded week → headline + highlights match seed data; fresh elder → zero-state copy, not an error; month vs week windows produce different `range`.
**Depends on:** B5.3.

---

## Contract stubs — other repos consume these (not built here)

So nothing in CORE.md is orphaned:

| Consumer | Contract | Backed by |
|---|---|---|
| `lively-bot` | Human Texting Engine (CORE §4): split 1–3 msgs, typing indicator, ≥2s delay, randomized morning window | Logs via B4.1/B4.2 — backend stores, never enforces timing |
| `lively-bot` | Companion context fetch per inbound (CORE §3 interface) | B4.1 response shape |
| `lively-bot` | Reminder cron per `schedule_times`; parse casual confirmations | Reads B6.1, logs B6.2; consecutive-miss counting is backend's (B6.3) |
| `lively-bot` | Pain/dizziness/emergency detection → immediate alert; `no_response` after 12h silence | B7.1 |
| `lively-bot` | Titipan delivery in persona voice | B8.2 queue |
| `lively-mobile` | Every endpoint above under family JWT | this backlog |
| `lively-landing` | Static page, no API dependency today | — |

---

## Proposed CORE.md amendments

CORE.md's rule: schema/endpoint changes update all four repo copies, no local workarounds. Apply these to CORE.md §1/§2 in all four repos **at kickoff, before the Day-1 freeze** — the backend can't be built to contract without them.

| # | Change | Why | Story |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Add `POST /auth/register`, `POST /auth/login` | JWT "issued by backend" with no issuing endpoint | B2.1 |
| 2 | Add `family_members.password_hash` | No credential storage in schema | B2.1 |
| 3 | Add `GET /elders`, `GET /elders/:id` | Mobile Home can't render without reading elders | B3.3 |
| 4 | Add `elders.paused boolean default false` | §2 lists "pause" but schema has no column | B3.2 |
| 5 | Add `GET /elders/:id/progress` | SPEC §3 promises aggregate; no read endpoint | B5.3 |
| 6 | Add `PATCH /medications/:id`, `GET /elders/:id/medications` | SPEC §4 says "edits"; mobile needs the list | B6.1 |
| 7 | Add `GET /alerts`, `PATCH /alerts/:id/resolve` | Schema has `resolved_at`; mobile must list + resolve | B7.3 |
| 8 | Add `PATCH /family-members/me` (push_token) | `push_token` column has no write path | B7.2 |
| 9 | Add `GET /bot/titipan-queue`, `PATCH /bot/titipan/:id/delivered` | `delivered_at` has no way to be set | B8.2 |
| 10 | Note in §2: `POST /bot/inbound` response carries CompanionConfig + `paused` + recent messages | Bot needs context in the same round-trip | B4.1 |
